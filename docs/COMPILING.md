# Compiling Friday Night Funkin'

0. Setup

    - Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://www.git-scm.com)
    - Do NOT download the repository using the Download ZIP button on GitHub or you may run into errors!
    - Instead, open a command prompt and do the following steps...
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/FunkinCrew/funkin.git` to clone the base repository.
2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to download the game's assets.

2. Run `haxelib --global install hmm` and then `haxelib --global run hmm setup` to install hmm.json
3. Run `hmm install` to install all haxelibs of the current branch
4. Run `haxelib run lime setup` to set up lime
5. Platform setup
   - For Windows, download the [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe)
        - When prompted, select "Individual Components" and make sure to download the following:
        - MSVC v143 VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools
        - Windows 10/11 SDK
    - Mac: [`lime setup mac` Documentation](https://lime.openfl.org/docs/advanced-setup/macos/)
    - Linux: [`lime setup linux` Documentation](https://lime.openfl.org/docs/advanced-setup/linux/)
    - HTML5: Compiles without any extra setup
6. If you are targeting for native, you may need to run `lime rebuild PLATFORM` and `lime rebuild PLATFORM -debug`

You can now run `lime test PLATFORM` with `-debug` (optional).
# Troubleshooting

- During the cloning process, you may experience an error along the lines of `error: RPC failed; curl 92 HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: PROTOCOL_ERROR (err 1)` due to poor connectivity. A common fix is to run ` git config --global http.postBuffer 4096M`.
